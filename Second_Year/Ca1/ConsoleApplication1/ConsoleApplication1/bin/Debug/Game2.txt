Hi Jack. What are you doing
Hi Mary. I'm filling out a job application
Are you finished with school already
No. I have one more semester, but it would be great to have a job lined up

How is your day going
Quite busy. I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy. I'm not even half done yet
You must feel stressed out now
That's an understatement

What are you doing now
I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall
I didn't know you play pool. Are you having fun
I'm having a great time. How about you? What are you doing?
I'm taking a break from my homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes

Are the dogs good
Are you good with fires
