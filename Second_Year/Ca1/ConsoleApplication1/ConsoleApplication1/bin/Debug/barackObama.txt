My fellow citizens:
I stand here today
humbled by the task before us, grateful for
the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the
sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank
President Bush for his service to our nation,
as well as the generosity and cooperation he
has shown throughout this transition.
Forty-four Americans have now
taken the presidential oath. The words have
been spoken during rising tides of prosperity
and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so
often the oath is taken amidst gathering
clouds and raging storms. At these moments,America has 
carried on not simply because
of the skill or vision of those in high
office, but because We the People have
remained faithful to the ideals of our
forbearers, and true to our foundingdocuments.
So it has been. So it must be
with this generation of Americans.
That weare in the midst of crisis is now well
understood. Our nation is at war, against a
far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence
of greed and irresponsibility on the part of
some, but also our collective failure to
make hard choices and prepare the nation for
a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed;
businesses shuttered. Our health care is too
costly; our schools fail too many; and each
day brings further evidence that the ways we
use energy strengthen our 
adversaries andthreaten our planet.
these are the
indicators of crisis, subject to data and
statistics. Less measurable but no less
profound is a sapping of confidence across
our land - a nagging fear that America's
decline is inevitable, and that the next
generation must lower its sights.
Today I
say to you that the challenges we face are
real. They are serious and they are many.
They will not be met easily or in a short
span of time. But know this, America - they
will be met.
hi On this day, we gather
we have chosen hope over fear, unity of
purpose over conflict and discord.
day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty
grievances and false promises, the
recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for
far too long have strangled our politics.
remain a young nation, but in the words of
Scripture, the time has come to set aside
childish things. The time has come to
reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our
better history; to carry forward that
precious gift, that noble idea, passed on
generation to generation: the
God-given promise that all are equal, all are
free, and all deserve a chance to pursue
their full measure of happiness.
reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we
understand that greatness is never a given.
It must be earned. Our journey has never been
one of short-cuts or settling for less. It
has not been the path for the faint-hearted -
for those who prefer leisure over 
seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.
Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the
doers, the makers of things - some celebrated
but more often men and women obscure in their
labor, who have carried us up the long,
rugged path towards prosperity and
For us, they packed up their few
worldly possessions and traveled across
oceans in search of a new life.
For us, they
toiled in sweatshops and settled the West;
endured the lash of the whip and plowed the
hard earth.
For us, they fought and died, in
places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy
and Khe Sahn.
Time and again these men and
women struggled and sacrificed and worked
till their hands were raw so that we might
live a better life. They saw America as
bigger than the sum of our individual
ambitions; greater than all the differences
of birth or wealth or 
journey we continue today. We remain the most
prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our
workers are no less productive than when this
crisis began. Our minds are no less
inventive, our goods and services no less
needed than they were last week or 
last
month or last year. Our capacity remains
undiminished. But our time of standing pat,
of protecting narrow interests and putting
off unpleasant decisions - that time has
surely passed. Starting today, we must pick
ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin
again the work of remaking America.
everywhere we look, there is work to be done.
The state of the economy calls for action,
bold and swift, and we will act - not only to
create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation
for growth. We will build the roads and
bridges, the electric grids and 
lines that feed our commerce and bind us
together. We will restore science to its
rightful place, and wield technology's
wonders to raise health care's quality and
lower its cost. We will harness the sun and
the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and
run our factories. And we will transform
our schools and colleges and universities to
meet the demands of a new age. All this we
can do. And all this we will do.
Now, there
are some who question the scale of our
ambitions - who suggest that our system
cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their
memories are short. For they have forgotten
what this country has already done; what free
men and women can achieve when 
is joined to common purpose, and necessity to
courage.What the cynics fail to understand
is that the ground has shifted beneath them -
that the stale political arguments that have
consumed us for so long no longer apply. The
question we ask today is not whether our
government is too big or too small, but
it works - whether it helps
families find jobs at a decent wage, care
they can afford, a retirement that is
dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend
to move forward. Where the answer is no,
programs will end. And those of us who manage
the public's dollars 
will be held to
account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits,
and do our business in the light of day -
because only then can we restore the vital
trust between a people and their
government.
Nor is the question before us
whether the market is a force for good or
ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand
freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has
reminded us that without a watchful eye, the
market can spin out of control - and that a
nation cannot 
prosper long when it favors
only the prosperous. The success of our
economy has always depended not just on the
size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on
the reach of our prosperity; on the ability
to extend opportunity to every willing heart
- not out of 
charity, but because it is the
surest route to our common good.
As for our
common defense, we reject as false the choice
between our safety and our ideals. Our
Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can
scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure
the rule of law and the rights of man, a
charter expanded by the blood of
generations. Those ideals still light the
world, and we will not give them up for
expedience's sake. And so to all other
peoples and governments who are watching
today, from the grandest capitals to the
small village where my father was born: know
that America 
is a friend of each nation and
every man, woman, and child who seeks a
future of peace and dignity, and we are ready
to lead once more.
Recall that earlier
generations faced down fascism and communism
not just with missiles and tanks, but with
the sturdy alliances and enduring
convictions. They understood that our power
alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle
us to do as we please. 
Instead, they knew
that our power grows through its prudent use;
our security emanates from the justness of
our cause, the force of our example, the
tempering qualities of humility and
restraint.
We are the keepers of this
legacy. Guided by these principles once more,
we can meet those new threats that demand
even greater effort - even greater
cooperation and understanding between
nations. We will begin to responsibly leave
Iraq to its people, and forge 
a hard-earned
peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and
former foes, we’ll work tirelessly to
lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the
specter of a warming planet. We will not
apologize for our way of life, nor will we
waver in its defense, and for those 
seek to advance their aims by inducing terror
and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now
that our spirit is stronger and cannot be
broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will
defeat you.
For we know that our patchwork
heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We
are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews
and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped
by every language and culture, drawn from
every end of this Earth; and because we have
the bitter swill of civil war and
segregation, and emerged from that dark
chapter stronger and more united, we cannot
help but believe that the old hatreds shall
someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall
soon dissolve; that as the world grows
smaller, our 
common humanity shall reveal
itself; and that America must play its role
in ushering in a new era of peace.
Muslim world, we seek a new way forward,
based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
To those leaders around the globe who seek to
sow conflict, or blame their society's ills
on the West - know that your people will
judge you on what you can build, not 
you destroy. To those who cling to power
through corruption and deceit and the
silencing of dissent, know that you are on
the wrong side of history; but that we will
extend a hand if you are willing to unclench
your fist.
To the people of poor nations, we
pledge to work alongside you to make your
farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to
nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.
And to those nations like ours that enjoy
relative plenty, we say we can no longer 
indifference to the suffering
outside our borders; nor can we consume the
world's resources without regard to effect.
For the world has changed, and we must change
As we consider the road that
unfolds before us, we remember with humble
gratitude those brave Americans who, at this
very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant
mountains. They have something to tell us,
just as the fallen heroes who lie in
Arlington whisper 
through the ages. We
honor them not only because they are
guardians of our liberty, but because they
embody the spirit of service; a willingness
to find meaning in something greater than
themselves. And yet, at this moment - a
moment that will define a 
generation - it
is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us
all.
For as much as government can do and
must do, it is ultimately the faith and
determination of the American people upon
which this nation relies. It is the kindness
to take in a stranger when the levees break,
the selflessness of workers who would rathe
their hours than see a friend lose
their job which sees us through our darkest
hours. It is the firefighter's courage to
storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also
a parent's willingness to nurture a child,
that finally decides our fate.
challenges may be new. The instruments with
which we meet them may be new. But those
values upon which our success depends -
honesty and hard work, courage and fair play,
tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and
patriotism - these things are old. These
are true. They have been the quiet
force of progress throughout our history.
What is demanded then is a return to these
truths. What is required of us now is a new
era of responsibility - a recognition, on the
part of every American, that we have duties
ourselves, our nation, and the world,
duties that we do not grudgingly accept but
rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge
that there is nothing so satisfying to the
spirit, so defining of our character, than
giving our all to a difficult task.
the price and the promise of
citizenship.
This is the source of our
confidence - the knowledge that God calls on
us to shape an uncertain destiny.
the meaning of our liberty and our creed -
why men and women and children of every race
and every faith can join in celebration
across this magnificent mall, and why a man
whose father less than sixty years ago might
not have been served at a local 
can now stand before you to take a most
sacred oath.
So let us mark this day with
remembrance, of who we are and how far we
have traveled. In the year of America's
birth, in the coldest of months, a small band
of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the
shores of an icy river. The capital was
abandoned. The 
enemy was advancing. The
snow was stained with blood. At a moment when
the outcome of our revolution was most in
doubt, the father of our nation ordered these
words be read to the people:
"Let it be
told to the future world...that in the depth
of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue
could survive...that the city and the
country, alarmed at one common danger, came
forth to meet [it]."
America. In the face
of our common dangers, in this winter of our
hardship, let us remember these timeless
words. With hope and virtue, let us brave
once more the icy currents, and endure what
storms may come. Let it be said by our
children's children that when 
we were
tested we refused to let this journey end,
that we did not turn back nor did we falter;
and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's
grace upon us, we carried forth that great
gift of freedom and delivered it safely to
future generations.
Thank you. God bless you
and God bless the United States of America
Hello Dublin, Hello Ireland.
My name is
Barack Obama, of the Moneygall Obama’s, and
I’ve come home to find the apostrophe that
we lost somewhere along the way.
Now, some
wise Irish man or woman once said that broken
Irish is better than clever English.
So here
goes: "Tá athas orm bheith in Éireann."
I’m happy to be in Ireland with so many a
chairde.
I want to thank my extraordinary
hosts – first of all, Taoiseach Enda Kenny
and his lovely wife Fionnuala, President
McAleese and her husband Martin for welcoming
me earlier today. Thank you Lord Mayor Robert
Green and the Garda for allowing me to crash
this celebration.
Let me also express my
condolences on the recent passing of the
former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald. Someone
who believed in the power of education,
believed in the potential of youth, and most
of all, believed in the potential of peace.
Someone who lived to see that peace
And most of all, thank you to the
citizens of Dublin and Ireland for the warm
and generous hospitality you have shown me
and Michelle.
It certainly feels like
100,000 welcomes. We feel very much at home.
I feel even more at home after that pint I
had. I feel even warmer.
In return, let me
offer the hearty greetings of tens of
millions of Americans who proudly trace their
heritage to this small island. They say
hello.
Now I knew I had some roots across
the Atlantic but until recently I could not
unequivocally claim that I was one of those
Irish-Americans. But now, if you believe the
Corrigan brothers, there is no one more Irish
than me. So I want to thank the genealogist
who traced my family tree – thank you!
turns out people take a lot of interest in
you when you are running for president. They
look into your past, they check out your
place of birth – things like that. I do
wish somebody had provided me with all this
evidence earlier because it would have come
in handy back when I was first running in my
hometown of Chicago. Because Chicago is the
Irish capital of the mid-west. A city where
it was once said you could stand on 79th
street and hear the brogue of every county in
Ireland.
So naturally, a politician like me
craved a slot in the St Patrick’s Day
parade. The problem was not many people knew
me or could not even pronounce my name. I
told them it was a Gaelic name – they
didn’t believe me.
One year a few
volunteers and me did make it into the parade
but we were literally the last marchers.
After two hours, finally it was our turn and
while we rode the route, smiling and waving,
the city workers were right behind us
cleaning up the garbage. It was a little
depressing but I bet those parade organisers
are watching TV today and feeling kind of bad
because this is a pretty good parade right
here.
Of course, an American doesn’t
really require Irish blood to understand that
ours is a proud, enduring, centuries-old
relationship. We are bound by history and
friendship and shared values. And that is why
I have come here today as an American
President – to reaffirm those bonds of
affection.
Earlier today, Michelle and I
visited Moneygall, where we saw my ancestral
home and dropped by the local pub. We
received a very warm welcome from all the
people there, including my long lost eighth
cousin Henry. Henry now is affectionately
known as Henry the Eighth.It was remarkable
to see this small town where a young
shoemaker named Fulmouth Kearney – my
great-great-great-grandfather.I was shown
the records from the parish, the recording of
his birth and we saw the home where helived.
He left during the Great Hunger, as
so many Irish did, to seek a new life in the
new world. He travelled by ship to New York,
where he entered himself into the records asa lay-boy.
He married an American girl from
Ohio. They settled in the mid-west and
started a family. It is a familiar story –
because it is one lived and cherished by
Americans of all backgrounds. It is integral
to our national identity, it is who we are
– a nation of immigrants from all around
the world.
But standing there in Moneygall,
I couldn’t help but think how heartbreaking
it must have been for that
great-great-great-grandfather of mine, and so
many others to depart, to watch Donegal
coasts and Dingle cliffs recede. To leave
behind all they knew in the hopes that
something better lay over the horizon.when
people like Fulmouth boarded those ships they
often did so with no family, no friends, no
money, nothing to sustain them but faith.
Faith in the All Mighty, faith in the idea of
America, faith that it was a place you could
be prosperous, you could be free, you could
think and talk and worship as you place, a
place where you could make it if youtried.
And as they worked and struggled and
sacrificed and sometimes experienced great
discrimination to build that better life for
the next generation, they passed on that
faith to their children and their
children’s children. An inheritance that
their great-great-great-grandchildren still
carry with them. We call it the AmericanDream.
It's the dream that Falmouth Kearney
was attracted to when he went to America.
It's the dream that drew my own father to
America from a small village in Africa. It's
a dream that we've carried forward -
sometimes through stormy waters, sometimes at
great cost - for more than two centuries. And
for my own sake, I'm grateful they made
those journeys because if they hadn't you'd
be listening to somebody else speak right
And for America's sake, we're
grateful so many others from this land took
that chance, as well.
After all, never has a
nation so small inspired so much in
Irish signatures are on our
founding documents. Irish blood was spilled
on our battlefields. Irish sweat built our
great cities. Our spirit is eternally
refreshed by Irish story and Irish song; our
public life by the humour and heart and
dedication of servants with names like
Kennedy and Reagan, O'Neill and
Moynihan.
So you could say there has always
been a little green behind the red, white and
blue.
When the father of our country, George
Washington, needed an army, it was the fierce
fighting of your sons that caused the British
official to lament, "We have lost America
through the Irish."
And as George
Washington said himself, "When our
friendless standards were first unfurled, who
were the strangers who first mustered around
our staff? And when it reeled in the light,
who more brilliantly sustained it than
Erin's generous sons?"
When we strove to
blot out the stain of slavery and advance the
rights of man, we found common cause with
your struggles against oppression. Frederick
Douglass, an escaped slave and our great
abolitionist, forged an unlikely friendship
right here in Dublin with your great
liberator, Daniel O'Connell. His time here,
Frederick Douglass said, defined him not as a
colour but as a man. And it strengthened the
non-violent campaign he would return home to
wage.
Recently, some of their descendents
met here in Dublin to commemorate and
continue that friendship between Douglass and
O'Connell.
When Abraham Lincoln struggled
to preserve our young union, more than
100,000 Irish and Irish Americans joined the
cause, with units like the Irish Brigade
charging into battle – green flags with
gold harp waving alongside our star-spangled
banner.
When depression gripped America,
Ireland sent tens of thousands of packages of
shamrocks to cheer up its countrymen, saying,
"May the message of Erin shamrocks bring joy
to those away."
And when an Iron Curtain
fell across this continent and our way of
life was challenged, it was our first Irish
President - our first Catholic President -
John F. Kennedy, who made us believe - 50
years ago this week - that mankind could do
something big and bold and ambitious as walk
on the moon. He made us dream again.
That is
the story of America and Ireland. That's the
tale of our brawn and our blood, side by
side, in making and remaking a nation,
pulling it westward, pulling it skyward,
moving it forward again and again and again.
And that is our task again today.
I think we
all realise that both of our nations have
faced great trials in recent years, including
recessions so severe that many of our people
are still trying to fight their way out. And
naturally our concern turns to our families,
our friends and our neighbours.
And some in
this enormous audience are thinking about
their own prospects and their own futures.
Those of us who are parents wonder what it
will mean for our children and young people
like so many who are here today. Will you see
the same progress we've seen since we were
your age? Will you inherit futures as big and
as bright as the ones that we inherited? Will
your dreams remain alive in our time?
This
nation has faced those questions before: When
your land couldn't feed those who tilled it;
when the boats leaving these shores held some
of your brightest minds; when brother fought
against brother.
Yours is a history
frequently marked by the greatest of trials
and the deepest of sorrow. But yours is also
a history of proud and defiant endurance. Of
a nation that kept alive the flame of
knowledge in dark ages; that overcame
occupation and outlived fallow fields; that
triumphed over its Troubles - of a resilient
people who beat all the odds.
And, Ireland,
as trying as these times are, I know our
future is still as big and as bright as our
children expect it to be. I know that because
I know it is precisely in times like these -
in times of great challenge, in times of
great change - when we remember who we truly
are.
We're people, the Irish and Americans,
who never stop imagining a brighter future,
even in bitter times. We're people who make
that future happen through hard work, and
through sacrifice, through investing in those
things that matter most, like family and
community.
We remember, in the words made
famous by one of your greatest poets that
"in dreams begins responsibility."
This is
a nation that met that responsibility by
choosing, like your ancestors did, to keep
alight the flame of knowledge and invest in a
world class education for your young people.
And today, Ireland's youth, and those
who've come back to build a new Ireland, are
now among the best educated, most
entrepreneurial in the world. And I see those
young people here today. And I know that
Ireland will succeed.
This is a nation that
met its responsibilities by choosing to apply
the lessons of your own past to assume a
heavier burden of responsibility on the world
stage. And today, a people who once knew the
pain of an empty stomach now feed those who
hunger abroad.
Ireland is working hand in
hand with the United States to make sure that
hungry mouths are fed around the world -
because we remember those times. We know what
crippling poverty can be like, and we want to
make sure we're helping others.
You're a
people who modernised and can now stand up
for those who can't yet stand up for
themselves. And this is a nation that met its
responsibilities - and inspired the entire
world – by choosing to see past the scars
of violence and mistrust to forge a lasting
peace on this island.
When President Clinton
said on this very spot 15 years ago, waging
peace is risky, I think those who were
involved understood the risks they were
taking.
But you, the Irish people,
persevered. And you cast your votes and you
made your voices heard for that peace. And
you responded heroically when it was
challenged. And you did it because, as
President McAleese has written, "For all the
apparent intractability of our problems, the
irrepressible human impulse to love kept
nagging and nudging us towards
reconciliation."
Whenever peace is
challenged, you will have to sustain that
irrepressible impulse. And America will stand
by you - always. America will stand by you
always in your pursuit of peace. And,
Ireland, you need to understand that you've
already so surpassed the world's highest
hopes. That what was notable about the
Northern Ireland elections two weeks ago was
that they came and went without much
attention. It's not because the world has
forgotten. It's because this once unlikely
dream has become that most extraordinary
thing of things: It has become real. A dream
has turned to reality because of the work of
this nation.
In dreams begin
responsibility.
And embracing that
responsibility, working toward it, overcoming
the cynics and the naysayers and those who
say "you can't" - that's what makes
dreams real.
That's what Falmouth Kearney
did when he got on that boat, and that's
what so many generations of Irish men and
women have done here in this spectacular
country.
That is something we can point to
and show our children, Irish and American
alike. That is something we can teach them as
they grow up together in a new century, side
by side, as it has been since our
This little country, that
inspires the biggest things - your best days
are still ahead. Our greatest triumphs - in
America and Ireland alike - are still to
And, Ireland, if anyone ever says
otherwise, if anybody ever tells you that
your problems are too big, or your challenges
are too great, that we can't do something,
that we shouldn't even try - think about all
that we've done together. Remember that
whatever hardships the winter may bring,
springtime is always just around the
And if they keep on arguing with
you, just respond with a simple creed: Is
féidir linn. Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Is
féidir linn.
For all you've contributed to
the character of the United States of America
and the spirit of the world, thank you. And
may God bless the eternal friendship between
our two great nations.
Thank you very much,
everybody.
Thank you, Dublin.
Thank you,Ireland.
To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin;
and to all my fellow citizens of this great
nation;
With profound gratitude and great
humility, I accept your nomination for the
presidency of the United States.
Let me express
my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who
accompanied me on this journey, and especially the
one who traveled the farthest - a champion for
working Americans and an inspiration to my
daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case
for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy,
who embodies the spirit of service; and to the
next Vice President of the United States, Joe
Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this
journey with one of the finest statesmen of our
time, a man at ease with everyone from world
leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he
still takes home every night.
To the love of my
life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to
Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so
proud of all of you.
Four years ago, I stood
before you and told you my story - of the brief
union between a young man from Kenya and a young
woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or
well-known, but shared a belief that in America,
their son could achieve whatever he put his mind
to.
It is that promise that has always set this
country apart - that through hard work and
sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual
dreams but still come together as one American
family, to ensure that the next generation can
pursue their dreams as well.
That's why I
stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and
thirty two years, at each moment when that promise
was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students
and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and
janitors -- found the courage to keep it
alive.
We meet at one of those defining moments
- a moment when our nation is at war, our economy
is in turmoil, and the American promise has been
threatened once more.
Tonight, more Americans
are out of work and more are working harder for
less. More of you have lost your homes and even
more are watching your home values plummet. More
of you have cars you can't afford to drive,
credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and
tuition that's beyond your reach.
These
challenges are not all of government's making.
But the failure to respond is a direct result of a
broken politics in Washington and the failed
policies of George W. Bush.
America, we are
better than these last eight years. We are a
better country than this.
This country is more
decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the
brink of retirement, finds herself one illness
away from disaster after a lifetime of hard
work.
This country is more generous than one
where a man in Indiana has to pack up the
equipment he's worked on for twenty years and
watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up
as he explains how he felt like a failure when he
went home to tell his family the news.
We are
more compassionate than a government that lets
veterans sleep on our streets and families slide
into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major
American city drowns before our eyes.
Tonight,
I say to the American people, to Democrats and
Republicans and Independents across this great
land - enough! This moment - this election - is
our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the
American promise alive. Because next week, in
Minnesota, the same party that brought you two
terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this
country for a third. And we are here because we
love this country too much to let the next four
years look like the last eight. On November 4th,
we must stand up and say: "Eight is
enough."
Now let there be no doubt. The
Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the
uniform of our country with bravery and
distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude
and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about
those occasions when he's broken with his party
as evidence that he can deliver the change that we
need.
But the record's clear: John McCain has
voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.
Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but
really, what does it say about your judgment when
you think George Bush has been right more than
ninety percent of the time? I don't know about
you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent
chance on change.
The truth is, on issue after
issue that would make a difference in your lives -
on health care and education and the economy -
Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
He said that our economy has made "great
progress" under this President. He said that the
fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when
one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his
economic plan - was talking about the anxiety
Americans are feeling, he said that we were just
suffering from a "mental recession," and that
we've become, and I quote, "a nation of
whiners."
A nation of whiners? Tell that to
the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who,
after they found out it was closing, kept showing
up every day and working as hard as ever, because
they knew there were people who counted on the
brakes that they made. Tell that to the military
families who shoulder their burdens silently as
they watch their loved ones leave for their third
or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not
whiners. They work hard and give back and keep
going without complaint. These are the Americans
that I know.
Now, I don't believe that Senator
McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives
of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why
else would he define middle-class as someone
making under five million dollars a year? How else
could he propose hundreds of billions in tax
breaks for big corporations and oil companies but
not one penny of tax relief to more than one
hundred million Americans? How else could he offer
a health care plan that would actually tax
people's benefits, or an education plan that
would do nothing to help families pay for college,
or a plan that would privatize Social Security and
gamble your retirement?
It's not because John
McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain
doesn't get it.
For over two decades, he's
subscribed to that old, discredited Republican
philosophy - give more and more to those with the
most and hope that prosperity trickles down to
everyone else. In Washington, they call this the
Ownership Society, but what it really means is -
you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No
health care? The market will fix it. Born into
poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps -
even if you don't have boots. You're on your
own.
Well it's time for them to own their
failure. It's time for us to change
America.
You see, we Democrats have a very
different measure of what constitutes progress in
this country.
We measure progress by how many
people can find a job that pays the mortgage;
whether you can put a little extra money away at
the end of each month so you can someday watch
your child receive her college diploma. We measure
progress in the 23 million new jobs that were
created when Bill Clinton was President - when the
average American family saw its income go up
$7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under
George Bush.
We measure the strength of our
economy not by the number of billionaires we have
or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether
someone with a good idea can take a risk and start
a new business, or whether the waitress who lives
on tips can take a day off to look after a sick
kid without losing her job - an economy that
honors the dignity of work.
The fundamentals we
use to measure economic strength are whether we
are living up to that fundamental promise that has
made this country great - a promise that is the
only reason I am standing here tonight.
Because
in the faces of those young veterans who come back
from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather,
who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in
Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful
nation with the chance to go to college on the GI
Bill.
In the face of that young student who
sleeps just three hours before working the night
shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister
and me on her own while she worked and earned her
degree; who once turned to food stamps but was
still able to send us to the best schools in the
country with the help of student loans and
scholarships.
When I listen to another worker
tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember
all those men and women on the South Side of
Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades
ago after the local steel plant closed.
And
when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of
starting her own business, I think about my
grandmother, who worked her way up from the
secretarial pool to middle-management, despite
years of being passed over for promotions because
she was a woman. She's the one who taught me
about hard work. She's the one who put off buying
a new car or a new dress for herself so that I
could have a better life. She poured everything
she had into me. And although she can no longer
travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and
that tonight is her night as well.
I don't
know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that
celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These
are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped
me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win
this election and keep our promise alive as
President of the United States.
What is that
promise?
It's a promise that says each of us
has the freedom to make of our own lives what we
will, but that we also have the obligation to
treat each other with dignity and
respect.
It's a promise that says the market
should reward drive and innovation and generate
growth, but that businesses should live up to
their responsibilities to create American jobs,
look out for American workers, and play by the
rules of the road.
Ours is a promise that says
government cannot solve all our problems, but what
it should do is that which we cannot do for
ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every
child a decent education; keep our water clean and
our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads
and new science and technology.
Our government
should work for us, not against us. It should help
us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not
just for those with the most money and influence,
but for every American who's willing to
work.
That's the promise of America - the idea
that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we
also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental
belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my
sister's keeper.
That's the promise we need
to keep. That's the change we need right now. So
let me spell out exactly what that change would
mean if I am President.
Change means a tax code
that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it,
but the American workers and small businesses who
deserve it.
Unlike John McCain, I will stop
giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs
overseas, and I will start giving them to
companies that create good jobs right here in
America.
I will eliminate capital gains taxes
for the small businesses and the start-ups that
will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of
tomorrow.
I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for
95% of all working families. Because in an economy
like this, the last thing we should do is raise
taxes on the middle-class.
And for the sake of
our economy, our security, and the future of our
planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in
ten years, we will finally end our dependence on
oil from the Middle East.
Washington's been
talking about our oil addiction for the last
thirty years, and John McCain has been there for
twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to
higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to
investments in renewable energy, no to renewable
fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of
oil as the day that Senator McCain took
office.
Now is the time to end this addiction,
and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap
measure, not a long-term solution. Not even
close.
As President, I will tap our natural gas
reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and
find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll
help our auto companies re-tool, so that the
fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right
here in America. I'll make it easier for the
American people to afford these new cars. And
I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next
decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy
- wind power and solar power and the next
generation of biofuels; an investment that will
lead to new industries and five million new jobs
that pay well and can't ever be
outsourced.
America, now is not the time for
small plans.
Now is the time to finally meet
our moral obligation to provide every child a
world-class education, because it will take
nothing less to compete in the global economy.
Michelle and I are only here tonight because we
were given a chance at an education. And I will
not settle for an America where some kids don't
have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood
education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers,
and pay them higher salaries and give them more
support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher
standards and more accountability. And we will
keep our promise to every young American - if you
commit to serving your community or your country,
we will make sure you can afford a college
education.
Now is the time to finally keep the
promise of affordable, accessible health care for
every single American. If you have health care, my
plan will lower your premiums. If you don't,
you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage
that members of Congress give themselves. And as
someone who watched my mother argue with insurance
companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I
will make certain those companies stop
discriminating against those who are sick and need
care the most.
Now is the time to help families
with paid sick days and better family leave,
because nobody in America should have to choose
between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick
child or ailing parent.
Now is the time to
change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions
are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time
to protect Social Security for future
generations.
And now is the time to keep the
promise of equal pay for an equal day's work,
because I want my daughters to have exactly the
same opportunities as your sons.
Now, many of
these plans will cost money, which is why I've
laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing
corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't
help America grow. But I will also go through the
federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs
that no longer work and making the ones we do need
work better and cost less - because we cannot meet
twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth
century bureaucracy.
And Democrats, we must
also admit that fulfilling America's promise will
require more than just money. It will require a
renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to
recover what John F. Kennedy called our
"intellectual and moral strength." Yes,
government must lead on energy independence, but
each of us must do our part to make our homes and
businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide
more ladders to success for young men who fall
into lives of crime and despair. But we must also
admit that programs alone can't replace parents;
that government can't turn off the television and
make a child do her homework; that fathers must
take more responsibility for providing the love
and guidance their children need.
Individual
responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's
the essence of America's promise.
And just as
we keep our keep our promise to the next
generation here at home, so must we keep
America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to
have a debate about who has the temperament, and
judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief,
that's a debate I'm ready to have.
For while
Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just
days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war,
knowing that it would distract us from the real
threats we face. When John McCain said we could
just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued
for more resources and more troops to finish the
fight against the terrorists who actually attacked
us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out
Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have
them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that
he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but
he won't even go to the cave where he
lives.
And today, as my call for a time frame
to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by
the Iraqi government and even the Bush
Administration, even after we learned that Iraq
has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing
in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his
stubborn refusal to end a misguided
war.
That's not the judgment we need. That
won't keep America safe. We need a President who
can face the threats of the future, not keep
grasping at the ideas of the past.
You don't
defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty
countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect
Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in
Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia
when you've strained our oldest alliances. If
John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more
tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice -
but it is not the change we need.
We are the
party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy.
So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend
this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't
keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has
squandered the legacy that generations of
Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have
built, and we are here to restore that
legacy.
As Commander-in-Chief, I will never
hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only
send our troops into harm's way with a clear
mission and a sacred commitment to give them the
equipment they need in battle and the care and
benefits they deserve when they come home.
I
will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish
the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in
Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet
future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough,
direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from
obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian
aggression. I will build new partnerships to
defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism
and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide;
climate change and disease. And I will restore our
moral standing, so that America is once again that
last, best hope for all who are called to the
cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and
who yearn for a better future.
These are the
policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I
look forward to debating them with John
McCain.
But what I will not do is suggest that
the Senator takes his positions for political
purposes. Because one of the things that we have
to change in our politics is the idea that people
cannot disagree without challenging each other's
character and patriotism.
The times are too
serious, the stakes are too high for this same
partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism
has no party. I love this country, and so do you,
and so does John McCain. The men and women who
serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and
Republicans and Independents, but they have fought
together and bled together and some died together
under the same proud flag. They have not served a
Red America or a Blue America - they have served
the United States of America.
So I've got news
for you, John McCain. We all put our country
first.
America, our work will not be easy. The
challenges we face require tough choices, and
Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast
off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
For part of what has been lost these past eight
years can't just be measured by lost wages or
bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is
our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher
purpose. And that's what we have to
restore.
We may not agree on abortion, but
surely we can agree on reducing the number of
unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality
of gun ownership may be different for hunters in
rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence
in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold
the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of
the hands of criminals. I know there are
differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we
can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and
sisters deserve to visit the person they love in
the hospital and to live lives free of
discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I
don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is
separated from her infant child or an employer
undercuts American wages by hiring illegal
workers. This too is part of America's promise -
the promise of a democracy where we can find the
strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in
common effort.
I know there are those who
dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim
that our insistence on something larger, something
firmer and more honest in our public life is just
a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the
abandonment of traditional values. And that's to
be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh
ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the
voters. If you don't have a record to run on,
then you paint your opponent as someone people
should run from.
You make a big election about
small things.
And you know what - it's worked
before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all
have about government. When Washington doesn't
work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes
have been dashed again and again, then it's best
to stop hoping, and settle for what you already
know.
I get it. I realize that I am not the
likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit
the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my
career in the halls of Washington.
But I stand
before you tonight because all across America
something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't
understand is that this election has never been
about me. It's been about you.
For eighteen
long months, you have stood up, one by one, and
said enough to the politics of the past. You
understand that in this election, the greatest
risk we can take is to try the same old politics
with the same old players and expect a different
result. You have shown what history teaches us -
that at defining moments like this one, the change
we need doesn't come from Washington. Change
comes to Washington. Change happens because the
American people demand it - because they rise up
and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new
politics for a new time.
America, this is one
of those moments.
I believe that as hard as it
will be, the change we need is coming. Because
I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen
it in Illinois, when we provided health care to
more children and moved more families from welfare
to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we
worked across party lines to open up government
and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give
better care for our veterans and keep nuclear
weapons out of terrorist hands.
And I've seen
it in this campaign. In the young people who voted
for the first time, and in those who got involved
again after a very long time. In the Republicans
who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic
ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who
would rather cut their hours back a day than see
their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who
re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good
neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane
strikes and the floodwaters rise.
This country
of ours has more wealth than any nation, but
that's not what makes us rich. We have the most
powerful military on Earth, but that's not what
makes us strong. Our universities and our culture
are the envy of the world, but that's not what
keeps the world coming to our shores.
Instead,
it is that American spirit - that American promise
- that pushes us forward even when the path is
uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our
differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what
is seen, but what is unseen, that better place
around the bend.
That promise is our greatest
inheritance. It's a promise I make to my
daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a
promise that you make to yours - a promise that
has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to
travel west; a promise that led workers to picket
lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
And
it is that promise that forty five years ago
today, brought Americans from every corner of this
land to stand together on a Mall in Washington,
before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young
preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
The
men and women who gathered there could've heard
many things. They could've heard words of anger
and discord. They could've been told to succumb
to the fear and frustration of so many dreams
deferred.
But what the people heard instead -
people of every creed and color, from every walk
of life - is that in America, our destiny is
inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can
be one.
"We cannot walk alone," the preacher
cried. "And as we walk, we must make the pledge
that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn
back."
America, we cannot turn back. Not with
so much work to be done. Not with so many children
to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not
with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and
farms to save. Not with so many families to
protect and so many lives to mend. America, we
cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this
moment, in this election, we must pledge once more
to march into the future. Let us keep that promise
- that American promise - and in the words of
Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the
hope that we confess.
Thank you, and God Bless
the United States of America.
Now that summer's over and gas prices have
finally come down a bit, there's a temptation to
put any discussion about energy on the back burner
until the next crisis arises. Gone are the days
when the President would make sweeping
pronouncements in his State of the Union about
America's addiction to oil - today there is far
more political mileage out of questioning
Democrats' commitment to fighting terror than by
affirming America's commitment to energy
independence.
But as the President may or may
not have learned by now, simply ignoring a problem
doesn't make it go away. Because while headlines
about price gouging and gas lines have temporarily
faded from the news, new headlines have emerged
that should have us every bit as concerned about
the addiction we just can't seem to shake.
In
just the last week, two in particular caught my
eye.
One is from the Detroit Free Press, and it
talks about how Ford Motor Company plans to cut
30,000 hourly jobs, 14,000 salaried jobs, and
close sixteen plants by 2012.
Now, there are
plenty of reasons for Ford's financial troubles,
but one of the most glaring has been their
inability to compete with foreign counterparts by
transitioning to the fuel-efficient and hybrid
vehicles that represent the future of the auto
industry.
200,000 of these hybrids are driving
around China today, a country that already has a
higher fuel economy than we do. Over in Japan,
Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius
to sell 100,000 in the U.S. this year. But at
Ford, there are plans to make only 20,000 Escape
Hybrids in 2006, and GM's brand won't be on the
market until 2007. Meanwhile, the waiting lists
for a hybrid car in this country get longer by the
day.
These foreign auto companies are
out-innovating and out-competing us, and if we do
nothing to help U.S. carmakers, tens of thousands
more jobs and billions in business will be heading
overseas in the months to come.
Unfortunately,
job losses and foreign competition are just the
half of it. Because the second headline that
caught my eye was in Saturday's New York Times,
and it read, "Suicide Attacks Foiled at 2 Oil
Sites in Yemen."
This news is disturbing, but
not surprising. For years, Al Qaeda has been
trying to attack Middle Eastern oil refineries as
a way to wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. Osama
bin Laden himself has said, "Focus your
operations on oil, especially in Iraq and the Gulf
area, since this will cause them to die off [on
their own]." In the past, even minor attacks have
caused global prices to jump $2 per barrel in a
single day. And a former CIA agent tells us that
if terrorists ever succeeded in destroying an
entire oil complex, it could take enough oil off
the market to cause financial catastrophe in
America.
More than anything else, headlines
like these represent a realization that goes far
beyond the temporary rise and fall of gas prices.
It's a realization that for all of our economic
dominance - for all of our military might - the
Achilles heel of the most powerful country on
Earth is the oil we cannot live without.
The
President knows this. That thousands of
autoworkers are losing their jobs. That we spend
$18 million on foreign oil ever hour. That our
climate is changing and global temperatures are
rising.
And yet, for someone who talks tough
about defending America, actually solving our
energy crisis seems to factor pretty low on the
President's agenda.
And that's because as
much as George Bush might want to defend America,
he also needs to defend his vision of government -
and that's a government that can't, won't, and
shouldn't solve great national challenges like
our energy dependence.
That's why the
President's funding for renewable fuels is at the
same level it was the day he took office. That's
why his budget funds less then half of the energy
bill he himself signed into law. That's why
billions of tax dollars that could've been used
to fund energy research went to the
record-profiting oil companies instead.
And
that's why it's time to stand up for a new
vision of government this November.
You see,
it's this timidity - this smallness - in our
politics that's holding us back right now. The
idea that some problems are just too big to
handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or
later, they'll go away.
But that's not where
the American people are. They still believe in an
America where anything's possible - they just
don't think their leaders do. They still dream
big dreams - they just sense their leaders have
forgotten how.
There's a reason that some have
compared the quest for energy independence to the
Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon landing. Like
those historic efforts, moving away from an oil
economy is a major challenge that will require a
sustained national commitment.
During World War
II, we had an entire country working around the
clock to produce enough planes and tanks to beat
the Axis powers. In the middle of the Cold War, we
built a national highway system so we had a quick
way to transport military equipment across the
country. When we wanted to beat the Russians into
space, we poured millions into a national
education initiative that graduated thousands of
new scientists and engineers.
If we hope to
strengthen our security and create hundreds of
thousands of new jobs, we can offer no less of a
commitment to energy independence.
With
technology we have on the shelves right now and
fuels we can grow right here in America, by 2025
we can reduce our oil imports by over 7.5. million
barrels per day - an amount greater than all the
oil we are expected to import from the entire
Middle East.
We start by producing cars that
use less oil. The auto industry has not been asked
to raise fuel economy standards in seventeen
years, and lately we've just stopped asking them
to.
Today, we have no choice. Starting in 2008,
if we raised CAF'E standards a modest 3% a year
over the next twelve years, by 2020 passenger
vehicles would average 40.5 mpg and light trucks
would average 32.6 mpg. This is by no means a
dramatic increase - five years ago, the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that raising CAF'E
to 33 mpg for passenger cars could easily be done
without compromising passenger safety.
Not only
would this reduce America's oil consumption, but
it would increase profits for the auto industry.
Yesterday a University of Michigan report came out
that said if the Big Three automakers took
proactive steps to increase the fuel-efficiency of
their vehicles, they would stand to gain up to $2
billion more in profits per year. But if they
continue on their current path, they could stand
to lose up to $3.6 billion in profits.
Of
course, auto executives are right when they say
that transitioning to these more fuel-efficient
automobiles would be costly at a time of sagging
profits and stiff competition, and that's
precisely why the federal government shouldn't
let the industry face these costs on their
own.
We should strike a grand bargain with the
Big Three automakers where the government picks up
part of the tab for their retiree health care
costs - a tab that ran almost $6.7 billion just
last year - in exchange for the car companies
using that savings to invest in more
fuel-efficient cars.
Beyond raising CAFE,
however, it's time we replace oil altogether as
America's fuel of choice. This doesn't just mean
singing the praises of ethanol and hoping that it
finds its way into our fuel supply on its own. It
means taking major steps now to put a national
biofuel infrastructure in place.
Already, some
cars on the road have the flexible-fuel tanks
necessary for them to run on E85, a cheaper,
cleaner blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. But
millions upon millions of cars still don't have
these tanks.
It's time for them to install
those tanks in every single car they make, and
it's time for the government to cover this small
cost, which currently runs at just $100 per car.
We should also make sure that from now on, every
single automobile the government purchases is a
flex-fuel vehicle.
It's also a time to start
making E85 fueling stations more available to the
public. Currently, only 681 out of 170,000 fueling
stations in America offer E85 pumps. This is not
acceptable. Every American should have the choice
to fill up their car with E85 at any fueling
station. And oil companies should stop standing in
the way and join us in making this happen. If the
big oil companies would devote just 1% of their
first quarter profits this year to install E85
pumps, more than 7,000 service stations would be
able to serve E85 to hungry motorists.
Finally,
we should reduce the risk of investing in
renewable fuels by providing loan guarantees and
venture capital to those entrepreneurs with the
best plans to develop and sell biofuels. And we
should create a market for renewable fuels by
ramping up the renewable fuel standard and
creating an alternative diesel standard in this
country that together would blend 65 billion
gallons of renewable fuels into the petroleum
supply each year.
In the days and months after
September 11th, Americans were waiting to be
called to something bigger than themselves. Just
like their parents and grandparents of the
Greatest Generation, they were willing to serve
and defend their country - not only on the fields
of war, but on the homefront too.
This is our
chance to step up and serve. For decades, we have
heard President after President call for energy
independence in this country, but for decades, we
have fallen short. Well it's time to call on
ourselves. We shouldn't wait for the next time
gas hits $3 a gallon - and we shouldn't accept
any more headlines that talk about a dying auto
industry or a terrorist plot to use oil as a
weapon against America. We should act - and we
should act now.
Now is the time for serious
leadership to get us started down the path of
energy independence. Now is the time for this call
to arms. I hope some of the ideas I've laid out
today can serve as a basis for this call, but I
also hope that members of both parties and all
levels of government can come together in the near
future to launch this serious quest for energy
independence. Thank you.
